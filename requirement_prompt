Your Task:
Your objective is to analyze, synthesize, and refine data from an Excel or csv file containing multiple test cases to reverse-engineer and generate a single, well-structured requirements document.

Input Data Description:
The input data will be an Excel table where each row represents a single test case, including the following columns:

Key (Unique identifier for the test case)
Summary (A brief title/summary of the test case)
Description (Detailed descriptive information for the test case)
Test Type (e.g., Functional, Performance, UI, API, Security)
Priority (Priority of the test case, e.g., High, Medium, Low)
Component (The system module or component name being tested)
Step/Action (Specific steps or actions to be performed during the test)
Data (Input data used in the test steps)
Expected Result (The expected correct outcome after executing the test steps)
Gherkin Definition (If BDD is used, the Gherkin syntax test scenario: Given/When/Then)
Unstructured Definition (Other unstructured definitions or notes)
Output Requirements Document Structure:
Please organize the generated requirements document according to the following structure:

1. Introduction & Overview
* Briefly state the purpose of this document (i.e., system requirement specifications reverse-engineered from the provided test case data).
* Summarize the system scope covered by this document and the main aspects tested, based on the distribution of Component and Test Type entries.

2. User Roles
* Identify and list the primary user roles that interact with the system (e.g., Administrator, Standard Registered User, Guest, Editor).
* Derivation Guidance:
* Analyze Summary, Description, and Step/Action to determine the initiators of actions and target users.
* If the Gherkin Definition includes "As a &lt;role>" descriptions, prioritize those.
* If roles are not explicit, list potential roles and clearly mark them as "[To be confirmed with stakeholders]".

3. Functional Requirements
* This section should be organized by major Features/Modules.
* Feature/Module Breakdown: Primarily use the values in the Component column for categorization. Each distinct Component can be treated as a feature or module.
* Under each Feature/Module, include one or more User Stories or functional points.
* Guidance for User Stories:
* Aggregate related test cases within the same Component that share similar themes in their Summary or Description to formulate User Stories.
* User Story Format: "As a &lt;identified User Role>, I want to &lt;function or action inferred from the Summary, Description, or core objective of the test case group>, so that &lt;inferred or to-be-confirmed business value/reason>."
* Crucial Note - "So that..." (Business Value):
* Test cases typically do not explicitly state business value. You will need to:
* Attempt to infer a reasonable business value based on the functional goal, clearly labeling it as: "[Inferred Value]: ..."
* Alternatively, if inference is difficult, state clearly: "[Business value to be confirmed with stakeholders]".
* User Story Priority: This can be set based on the Priority of the underlying test cases (e.g., by taking the highest priority or a consolidated assessment).
* For each User Story, list its Acceptance Criteria (ACs):
* Guidance for Acceptance Criteria:
* The core content of each relevant test case forms one or more ACs.
* If a Gherkin Definition is complete and available, use it directly as an AC (Given/When/Then format).
* Otherwise, derive ACs from Step/Action (user actions), Data (input), and Expected Result (outcome). These can be phrased as: "Scenario: [Precondition, possibly from Description or implicit]. When [user action and input data], Then [system's expected response]."
* Use the test case Key as a reference ID for its corresponding AC.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
* Identify and consolidate NFRs based on the Test Type (e.g., Performance, Security, Usability, Compatibility).
* Derivation Guidance:
* Filter test cases where the Test Type relates to NFRs (e.g., "Performance," "Security").
* Translate the Expected Result of these test cases into specific NFR statements. For example: "Performance: [A specific action, from the test case context] should be completed within [X seconds, from Expected Result]."
* NFRs can also be associated with a corresponding Priority.

5. Data Requirements (Overview)
* Provide a high-level, summary description of key data entities, types, or formats frequently observed in the Data column and Description.
* This section is not intended to be a complete data dictionary, but rather a high-level observation.

6. User Interface Requirements (Overview)
* Based on recurring key UI elements (e.g., buttons, forms, specific information display areas) and interaction flows mentioned in Step/Action and Expected Result, provide a high-level description.
* Focus on "what needs to be on the UI" rather than detailed visual design.

7. Assumptions and Constraints
* List any significant assumptions made during the reverse-engineering process or any obvious constraints evident from the test cases.

General Instructions:

The goal is synthesis, refinement, and structured presentation, not just a simple listing of test cases.
Maintain a clear, professional, and well-organized writing style.
For any inferred information (especially user roles and business value) or items requiring further stakeholder confirmation, clearly indicate this.
Ensure the final document is logically coherent and clearly shows the derivation path from test data to requirements.
